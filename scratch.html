        <h1> Reflection Questions & Answers:</h1>
        <h2> 1/ Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game</h2>
        <p> Some concepts that I used to create this game were creating variables to set the movement and speed of the square and also to record score. Another concept was using if-else statements in order to determines which color the square touches and which action should it does next.</p>
        <h2> 2/ Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h2>
        <p> During the process of creating the game, the biggest struggle was to make the red blocks move at the right speed and angle to make it difficult yet fair to the player. I figured out the best values for the speed and angle through trials and error, plugging in many numbers until I find one that is perfect.</p>
        <h2> 3/ What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
        <p> My favorite thing about the game was when I was designing the level, where I discovered that I could make the pink square moves on letters that are white. It gives the level a more interesting look rather than just white blocks.</p>
        <h2> 4/ If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h2>
        <p> If more time was given, I would fix a bug where the player dies at the beginning of the game, redesign all the surfaces into letters or numbers, and add more challenging levels to the game.</p>
